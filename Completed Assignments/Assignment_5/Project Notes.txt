Wrote compare function in toDoList.c (L29)   Used same format as our last compare

To test the toDoList.c file, we can use pre-written ordered Bad interface.
I will be using this to start with, afterwards, we will repace the following

addHeap -> addDynArrOrd
removeMinHeap -> removeAtDynArr(v, 0)
getMinHeap -> getDynArr (v, 0)


Exicutibles,	prog  is for testing of toDoList   	main.c
				sprog is testing Heap				main2.c
				
'l' to load to-do list from file (function provided for you)
's' to save to-do list to file (function provided for you)
'a' to add a new task to the to-do list
'g' to get the first task from the to-do list
'r' to remove the first task from the to-do list
'p' to print the to-do list (function provided for you)
'e' to exit the program

struct Task {
	char description[TASK_DESC_SIZE];  	/* description of the task */
	int priority;			  			/* task priority */
};
